            <h1>Procurement reform</h1>
            <p>SBAIC is focused on helping the U.S. government (USG) meet its small business targets and increase small business utilization in foreign assistance programs. SBAIC is very pleased that meeting small business targets is a topline Mission indicator for global acquisition funds and continues to support this undertaking through our advocacy efforts.  We continue to urge the USG agencies to set more ambitious goals, aimed at meeting or exceeding the USG small business goal of 23.5%.</p>
            <p>We adopt supporting policies, such as standard language in Requests for Proposals (RFPs) on small business inclusion and full implementation of the Woman-owned Small Business (WOSB) 8(M) program. We collaborate with USG partners to eliminate unintended confusion between use of small business and local entities in overseas contracting, and continue to work with partners on modifying rules with potential negative affects to small business utilization including: new SBA rules; characterization of consultants; rules specific to utilization of specific sub-categories of small businesses; and rules regarding use of direct placement of task orders under Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQs).</p>
