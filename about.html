                         is a membership organization established to promote the meaningful
                          utilization of U.S. small businesses at U.S. government agencies
                           providing foreign assistance, such as the: U.S. Agency for
                            International Development (USAID), Millennium Challenge Corporation
                             (MCC), Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), and the U.S.
                              Departments of State, Defense, Health and Human Services and Agriculture.</p>
                </div>

            <div class="content-text-2">
                        <p>SBAIC currently has over 200 small business members spread across nearly 25 U.S. states,
                         of which more than half are small disadvantaged businesses (i.e., HubZone, minority-owned,
                          8(a), woman-owned, veteran-owned). Our members work in every development sector,
                           including agriculture and food security, democracy, human rights and governance, economic
                            growth and trade, education, environment and global climate change, gender equality and
                             women’s empowerment, global health, science, technology and innovation and working in
                              crisis and conflict. With an average of 15 years of U.S. federal government experience,
                               each of our members brings a wide range of expertise in business intelligence and
                                analytics, capacity building, disaster response, economic development, education,
                                 gender analysis, IT, knowledge management, public financial management, tourism,
                                  workforce development.<br><br>

                        Our small business members are prime contractors on 80 percent of the work we implement,
                         and many of the contracts are equivalent in size and complexity to those held by larger
                          entities. Contracts range from $100,000 to $42 million. These contracts are managed using U.S.
                           government compliant financial and program management systems. Staffed by development
                            entrepreneurs, former U.S. government staff and large-business executives, our small businesses
                             operate with a combination of seasoned oversight, agility and innovation characteristic
                              of smaller organizations.<br><br>
                        
                        SBAIC was established in the early 2000s by a dedicated group of U.S. small businesses working
                         in international development to promote small business utilization at the U.S. Agency for
                          International Development (USAID). After tremendous growth in both membership and stature under
                           Indira Ahluwalia’s leadership from 2010-2012, there was a need to formalize the organization.
                            During Betsy Bassan’s time as Chair from 2013-2015, we registered as a tax exempt organization,
                             created an annual dues system for our members, and established a Board of Directors to
                              spearhead the annual strategic planning process for setting SBAIC’s advocacy agenda and Committee
                               goals and activities. In 2016, Carlos Rivera was elected the Chair of SBAIC and under his
                                leadership we expanded our attention from solely focusing on USAID to include all 20 U.S.
                                 government agencies providing foreign assistance.</p>
