                <p>
                        SBAIC encourages its members to join one of its four
                         committees: Communications, Membership, Outreach and Procurement.
                          Each committee meets regularly outside of its scheduled
                           bi-monthly member meetings and has its own strategy/plan
                            working in tandem with one another and with the Executive
                             Committee. To learn more about each committee’s ongoing activities
                              or to join a committee, please contact co-chairs directly.
